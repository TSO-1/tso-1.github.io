              <h3>What we do ?</h3>
              <p> Our bespoke tours throughout The Gambia and Senegal are designed to explore the wealth of wildlife and natural habitats that the region
                has to offer, ranging from day trips to the key birdwatching sites near the coast to extensive tours
                exploring the myriad of rarely-visited inland locations.</p>

                <h3>Why Choose Us ?</h3>
                <p>Our research team has grown significantly in the last few years attracting lots of other young
                  birdwatchers and guides to join in with the trips. During their recent research expeditions, they have
                  discovered rare species such as Forbes Plover, Capuchin Babbler, Little Rush Warbler and Golden-Breasted
                  Bunting.</p>

                  <h3>Our Process</h3>
                  <p> We help coordinate an enthusiastic group of young African birders that meets up regularly through the
                    year, and conducts exciting research trips in the off-season to discover new birdwatching sites and rarely
                    seen species, often in less-often visited parts of the country.</p>

              <p>
                Abuko is small nature reserve lying between Serrekunda and Lamin. It is a popular tourist attraction and
                was the country’s first designated wildlife reserve. The reserve is great for birdwatching, having three
                different habitats - gallery forest, open woodland and savannah areas - in close proximity. Species you
                can see include Giant Kingfisher, Blue-breasted Kingfisher, Green Turaco, Violet Turaco, Yellowbill and
                Western Bluebill.

                Only 30 minutes drive away from the Kololi and Senegambia hotels, this area of flooded pools, palm groves
                and vegetable-growing fields is a very productive spot and excellent introduction to the delights of
                birdwatching in The Gambia. Species regularly seen around the area include Greater Painted-snipe, Northern
                White-faced Owl, Blue-cheeked Bee-eater, Little Bee-eater, Levaillant’s Cuckoo and African Cuckoo.

                Brufut Woods is a dense, dry and scrubby forest which has a good network of paths and is home to the
                legendary Dr Owl, a local ornithologist whose profession is to locate the nesting and roosting Verreaux’s
                Eagle Owl, White-faced Owl and resting spots of the Long-tailed Nightjar. With care, you can observe the
                Nightjars from only a few metres away without disturbing them.

              <p>
                Down the coast from the main tourist areas, the dry scrubland and forest at Tanji has many sandy paths
                that lead to a series of beachside lagoons. A hotspot for sunbirds and many other species, including lots
                of migrant warblers. The coastal areas are great for waders, terns, gulls and Ospreys - a must-visit
                location in any season. Species which can be seen include White-shouldered Black Tit, Whistling Cisticola,
                Four-banded Sandgrouse, Yellow-fronted Tinkerbird, Oriole Warbler and Northern Crombec.

                staff are very friendly, serving excellent food and the welcome drinks after a successful boat trip across
                the river to the Baobolong reserve on the northern bank. Egret and kite roosts, many varieties of heron,
                African Darter and, if you are lucky, a glimpse of a Pel’s Fishing Owl, are some of the highlights. On the
                south bank, paths through the local woodland offer some great general birdwatching opportunities.

                  I am a young and enthusiastic Gambian who has benefitted from a strong western education at schools in
                  Banjul. After completion of my schooling, nature has become my most dedicated passion and I have developed
                  massively over the last few years learning from the most experienced bird guides in The Gambia. I spent a
                  considerable amount of time closely watching birds in the field around my home in Tunjina and building a
                  comprehensive understanding of their life-cycles and habits. I continued my training in Farasutu Forest
                  Community Nature Reserve for nine years with intensive research on different species of birds and their
                  characters.
                  Working closely with some of the best guides in The Gambia has exposed me to many new birds and habitats
                  across the whole country and beyond. With the experience I gained, I have guided many top birdwatchers and
                  wildlife experts from all over the world, particularly when they have visited the Farasuto Forest Reserve
                  and other local sites, showing them many Gambian specialties.
                  “Mustapha is a keen birdwatcher who knows his species, and on top of that he is a social guy who makes an
                  effort to show all his participants the best birds in the area. I met Mustapha in Farasuto Forest, where
                  he carefully prepared our visit by searching all the good species in advance. Species like African Wood
                  Owl, White-backed Night Heron, Green Crombec, Hylia, Yellow-billed Malkoha and many others came for the
                  binoculars of my group through his efforts. I can certainly recommend his pleasant company!” – Klaas de
                  Jong, Netherlands
                  “Mustapha…impressed me with his knowledge of his home area and the birds of Farasuto. Mustapha has
                  contributed to an ongoing project that aims to investigate the diet of White-faced and African Wood Owls.
                  I wish him well with further research input at Farasuto which I hope can be protected from encroachment.
                  With guidance it’s a great place to find a number of Gambia’s sedentary forest adapted birds” – Clive
                  Barlow, The Gambia
                  “I came to The Gambia about 15 times already to photograph birds. As a guide I recommend without a doubt
                  Mustapha Ceesay. Mustapha it is very knowledgeable reliable person you can count on” – Marc Bruyndoncx,
                  Belgium

                    I am a young Gambian bird guide with a keen interest in conservation and research. On completion of my
                    academic schooling, I obtained a certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the Gambia
                    Technical Training Institute. At the same time, I was inspired by friends Moses and Heather to get
                    involved in birdwatching and I started studying birds at the Abuko Nature Reserve over a two year period.
                    After completing my training at Abuko, I joined the team at Farakunku Lodge as a bird guide, taking
                    visitors out on trips all over The Gambia. During my time as a guide at Farakunku I guided numerous
                    birdwatchers and clients on diverse tours. Since then, I have been very active with the research team,
                    organising and taking part in many trips and tours around the region.
                    “We first met Lie in December 2019 whilst we were staying at Farakunku Lodges. Lie was our birdwatching
                    guide for the duration of our 3 week stay. Throughout our holiday Lie was always on time, was very
                    considerate and patient and very easy to get along with. Lie went to extra lengths to ensure that my
                    elderly parents were given options to rest and was always flexible in the way that we approached our
                    birdwatching. It was always a pleasure to birdwatch with Lie, we visited various different locations and
                    we feel that he always tried his best to get the most out of each trip. We would not hesitate to recommend
                    Lie as a guide” – Craig & Dawn, UK
                    “Lie was a great birding guide and made sure we spotted lots of amazing birds on our holiday” – Rose W, UK
                    “Lie is an excellent birding guide, if we ever go back to Gambia he would be my first choice!” – Steve H,
                    UK
                    “Lie guided three of us for a week in January 2020 when we found him to be a talented and knowledgeable
                    guide who showed us many of the local birds. He took us to a variety of habitats enabling us to see a wide
                    range of species. He is friendly, easy to talk to and very enthusiastic about his birds - especially the
                    species which are a little more difficult to track down” – Heather S, UK

                    I began my birdwatching and guiding career as a park ranger at the Brufut Woods reserve, where I spent
                    considerable time studying birds for over a period of 5 years. I then joined the West African Bird Study
                    Association (WABSA), a conservation NGO which is based at the Abuko Nature Reserve, where I trained for a
                    further two years. During both these periods of intensive birding and wildlife study I became familiar
                    with the wide diversity of species in the Senegambian region. More recently, I have been posted at the
                    Brufut Woods reserve as one of the resident guides, adding a new photohide at the site for photographers
                    to come and enjoy. In the last ten years, I have had the pleasure of guiding many birdwatchers and
                    visitors all over The Gambia and Senegal. I have more than 13 years experience of guiding people around
                    the stunning wildlife sites in The Gambia and have seen over four hundred bird species during this time.
                    “I have known Madi for 4 years and would highly recommend his services as a bird guide in The Gambia. Madi
                    is always patient taking time to make sure everyone sees the birds, he is polite, well respected and
                    always happy to help” – Richard H, UK
                    “Madi is a very good guide who takes care of his clients and explains everything they want to know about
                    each species, he is really a good guide who I can recommend for anyone” – Mustapha & Tiina, Finland
                    “Exploring hidden gems of habitat in The Gambia packed with wonderful wildlife is always a massive
                    pleasure when being guided by Madi. He knows the sites intimately and always is one step ahead in spotting
